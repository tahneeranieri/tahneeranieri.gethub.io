    <p>I liked this site because I once lived in Utah, and my favorite freetime activity is skiing. I also like the layout of this website. It really takes your eyes for a trip around the page. </p>
    <li><a href="http://www.powder.com/brand/on3p/#K9OleZDJJBbh0qcb.97">Powder Magazine</a></li>
    <p>I choose this website to stay on the topic of winter and skiing. Powder is one of my favorite magazines. As far as structure of the page, I like how easy it is to navigate through. However, I don't like how much of their page is advertisement. </p>
    <li><a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/about-our-products/organic-food">Organic Foods</a></li>
    <p>I enjoyed this website because of the content. It's something I am also passionate about along with skiing. I also enjoy the color choices and layout of the page.</p>
